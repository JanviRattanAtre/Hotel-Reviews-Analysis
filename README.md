# Hotel Reviews Analysis

## Overview

The **Hotel Reviews Analysis** project focuses on extracting insights from hotel reviews by performing text analysis and sentiment classification. This project is designed to help businesses and stakeholders understand customer sentiments, identify key topics of discussion, and improve services based on customer feedback.

## Objectives

- Preprocess and clean customer reviews to prepare data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract trends and patterns from the reviews.
- Apply sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Visualize the results to provide actionable insights.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Handles tasks like tokenization, removing stop words, lemmatization, and vectorization.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment scoring.
- **Topic Analysis:** Extracts key themes and topics from customer reviews using methods like word clouds or topic modeling.
- **Visualization:** Generates graphs and charts to summarize review sentiments and other trends.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Text Processing:** nltk, spaCy
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, possibly a pre-trained NLP model
